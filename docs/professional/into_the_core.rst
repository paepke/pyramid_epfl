A Journey into the core of the EPFL onion
=========================================

Any given request will pass through a big number of different layers both inside EPFL and inside Pyramid in order to
produce a response. As a core developer every aspect of how this is handled may be important to you, so let's try to
give this some structure.

Have fun on your journey into the core of EPFL!
